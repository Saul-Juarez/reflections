How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It spoted the differences right away, making it easier to spot mistakes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It becomes easier and faster to pick up code and adapt it to different needs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro. We get only significant changes saved
    Con. If a commit is too big, it can be more difficult to get back to a particular state

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because some work do require to keep track of multiple files and others don't

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can be used to obtain the commit identifiers
    git diff can be used to see the changes made to the file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing that at any given time I can go back, I can take higher risks

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Nothing
